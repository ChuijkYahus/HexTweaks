AntiAmbitField (grand spell): Vec, Number, Number ->
    takes a position, diameter, and duration
    during that time the affected area will *always* be out of ambit

Phial Enchantments:
    probably a new grand spell (or mass mindflay allows the Vec to be an entity)
    `l` is the enchantment level in the equations
    There could be some Phial enchantments, that would determine its level based on villager count. For ex
    Greed -> increases capacity, but media taken isn't linear, take 1 dust, it eats 1 dust, but take 1 charged, and it eats 1.5 charged
    Optimal design -> when you charge it, it gets slightly more media, could also be nonlinear
    Hardwork -> decreases media consumption from the phial, but the more media you put in it at once the less you get from one recharge cast
    Ambient Extraction -> the phial slightly recharges very slowly
    Overcharge -> you can overcharge your Phial, but media over the limit either gets recharged less efficiently or it slowly dissipates
    Stretch -> you can overcharge your phial, but it slightly increases the max media in the phial (everything else extra is discarded)

Mark: (Vec,number->) +mixin (to extend ambit in CastingContext)
    it is basically a Greater sentinel, but,  you can summon multiple
    and only valid for a specific time
    (cost increases the more you summon, and cost increases if summoned out of ambit))
    you can destroy them to bring the cost back-down
UnMark: (Vec->)
    removes a "mark" placed by mark (does not become inactive)
Mark's Refl. (->[Vec])
    returns a list of the locations of all your active marks.
Mark's Refl. II (->[Vec])
    returns a list of the locations of all your expired marks

Pointer Iota:
    basically a Rc<Iota> so that you can borrow iotas
